Previous studies have shown that customers are not managed as important assets. Customer profitability varies; not all customers are equally desirable. So also customers vary in their needs, preferences, buying behavior and price sensitivity by understanding customer drivers and customer profitability, companies can tailor their offerings to maximize the overall value for their customer portfolio which can cause economic failure to the company, therefore, this research project will foster to design and implement a customer care management system based on the research objectives.</p>
